// KEYWORDS TO DECLARE VARIABLES WITH //

// LET keyword //
let city = 'Ohio';

let country;
country = 'India';
country = ' America';

// This is basically type of assignments as you see in case of city we use                      
// LET keyword which has blocked scope.                                     |
//                                                                          |
// We baically have a variable city and we declare and assign a value to it |
// in a single statemnt.                                                    |
//                                                                          |
// While in case of country we first declare and later asssign a value to   |
// country and as well as we re-assign the country variable.                |                                                  
//                                                                          |
// So, this is the ways of how you can assign a value to variable in case of|
// LET keyword.                                                             |
//                                                                          |
// We can actually re-assign a value which is assigned with let keyword and |
// output will be the last assigned value.                                  |
//                                                                          |
// Do remeber you cannot redecalre variable, you only re-declares its value |
// in case of block-scoped keyword.                                         |


// CONST keyword //
const name = 'JOHN';                                                         

// Here comes the other way to declare a variable but here is the twist we  |
// have to declare variable & assign the value to it at once.               |
//                                                                          |                                                                    |
// Secondly, CONST also has a blocked-scope keyword and variable decalres   |
// with it cannot be use outside the block they declared.                   |                                                   
//                                                                          |
// Like LET we cannot re-decleares CONST variable, means once declared it   |
// cannot be redeclared in the same block.                                  |
//                                                                          |
// Here, you cannot even redecalres the value of variable in same block, it |
// remains constant througout the same block.                               | 


// VAR keyword //
var place = ' india' 
var place 
place = 25 

// Here comes the other way to declare variable which has almost looks like |
// LET but here we can decalre as well as redecalre both value and name of  |
// variable, and it is not blocked scope keyword.                           |
//
// The output of redecalred variable with VAR will always the last assigned |
// value which is assigned to variable.                                     |
